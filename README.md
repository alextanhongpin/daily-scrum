# daily-scrum

My daily scrum, using git.


## Thoughts

Is this an effective way to record progress? Yes, but it's not an easy way to evaluate outcome.

Progress does not equal result.

A better way is to

1. set a goal with measurable outcome, using user story
2. outline the steps to accomplish it
3. present your learnings


## Iteration

Start a daily readme with a daily goals.

Then record your progress as you go.

Separate work and private ones.
